Purpose:

	To brighten your day at the console with a randome quote much like the
old program fortune.

Work you Must Do:

	- download quote.rb from the repo

	- add this to bashrc
	    ruby /path/to/downloaded/script/quote.rb

	- Enjoy it each time you fire up your shell

This is my first ruby script I have posted much more to come. Please enjoy critique laugh at me
and my spelling but most importantly be well.

Updates:

  2/28/12: The script would hang when there was no wan connection it now ping google and exits if there is no connection
