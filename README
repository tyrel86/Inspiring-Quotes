Purpose:

	To brighten your day at the console with a randome quote much like the
old program fortune.

Work you Must Do:

	- install the Colorize Gem
	    $ sudo gem install colorize

	- download quote.rb from the repo

	- add this to bashrc
	    ruby /path/to/downloaded/script/quote.rb

	- Enjoy it each time you fire up your shell

Posible Modification:

	- The array possible_colors on line 18 is used to pick a randome color from String.colors
	if you fire up irb and type String.colors you can pick the ones you like and put there
	index values in the array
	
	- You can pick another RSS feed though you will need to modify lines 22 and 23
	i.e. rss.channel.fitting-tag.fitting-tag

	- Also on lines 22 and 23 you can change the second argument to the wrap_text methods to
	expand or compress the output

This is my first ruby script I have posted much more to come. Please enjoy critique laugh at me
and my spelling but most importantly be well.

Updates:

  2/28/12: I noticed when the network was down the script would hang for some time and then dump some ruby errors which does not brighten
  your day at the console so it now pings google insures WAN existance and the initiates or displays a clean error message. Enjoy:)
